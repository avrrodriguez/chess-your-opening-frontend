# chess-your-opening-frontend

## Description
Chess Your Opening is an application in which a user can see a list of openings and from there choose which to add to their studies. In the studies, the user is able to have more in depth information about the opening such as common moves and positions, as well as games played by high level players in which that opening is used.

This git hub repo contains the front end for the application and the back end can be found [here](https://github.com/avrrodriguez/chess-your-opening). 

## Technical Information
The front end is a multi-page application that was built using React, bootstrap, and npm. 

- Bootstrap was used to style the different pages.
- Axios was used to make requests to a third party API, from which example chess games for the openings were obtained.
- Through the chess games and lichess embed, interactive games in which one can go to any move and go move by move was available for the user to use.
